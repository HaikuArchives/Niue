	ABOUT NIUE


Welcome to Niue!
Niue is a basic, easy to use but powerful development environment. Or, Niue is an application 
for BeOS/Haiku which makes it easy to develop applications for BeOS/Haiku. It comes with a 
syntax styled code editor and handy features to build and export your projects. Besides that Niue 
has a very cool way to find development projects on your system. Read the documentation to find 
out how to use Niue.

Niue wouldn't have been possible without the freely available sourcecode of the following projects:

	Yate, by Chris Blackbourne,
	EZLauncher, by Robert Polic,
	File-To-Resource, by Gabriele Biffi,
	The Mover class, by Sylvian Tertois,
	The IconMenu class, by Rene Gollent,
	The BarberPole class, by Micheal Pfeiffer,

And everyone working on, or supporting Haiku. Because Niue owes so much to those above I want
to be sure that future developers can always rely on the codebase of Niue and therefor the Niue 
sources are always available by request.

Niue is developed by: Tako Lansbergen (a.ka. 0033)
