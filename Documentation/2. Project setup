	PROJECT SETUP


A Niue project isn't really a project. It's simply a folder containing a bunch of sourcecode files, a 
makefile and maybe some resources. Projects are opened by selecting their folder from File->Open 
Project'. 

There is also another, more exotic, way of opening projects. Instead op choosing File->Open Project, 
you can also go for File->Browse Projects. Now Niue finds all folders containing a makefile in the 
location you provide. Be careful though, there is no guarantee that these are all projects. It's up to 
you to decide if the results are what you are looking for.

To add files to your project choose Project->Add Files To Project. All files you select are copied from 
their original location to your project folder. To remove a file from your project to right-click it and 
select 'Remove from project'. The file is moved from your project folder to Trash so it's easy to 
recover mistakes. 

Besides removing files there is more you can do to a file with a right-click. Most options will speak for 
itself but there one that deserves some explanation. Sometimes it might happen that a file is sorted 
under Resources while you know that it is actually sourcecode. When this happens you can choose 
'Mark as source' to, well, mark it as source.

While you are working on a project it is also up to you to keep your makefile up to date. By choosing 
Make, Make Clean or Run you tell Niue to make your project by the makefile's rules. Note that 
because of that files that added to your project are not automatically included in your build. To make
your life easier there's also an option to define the 'Build Rules', (Project->Build Rules). Fill out he form
and Niue will create a new makefile for you.

	Tip: Use Ctrl-9 and Ctrl-0 to easily switch between files!

To help you keeping track of your actions, Niue displays files that are unsaved in red. Make sure to
save your changes before you build your project.
