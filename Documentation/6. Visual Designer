	VISUAL DESIGNER


Niue Visual Designer is a tool to help you with the layout of controls.
Usage should be pretty straightforward, select a control from the right, click on the grid to add and an
use the input fields on the left to fine tune the control. Additionally you can align all the dropped
elements and use the (square-red) handles to move and resize controls. 
By clicking the 'Generate Code'  button Niue will write some lines of code for you to use in 
your project.

To start a new project with the layout you've created, choose 'Start Project'. A new project will be 
created with the chosen element in the main view.

Only the most common controls are available right now, more will be added later. In the distant future 
the Visual Designer will also be able to load designs from code and interact with Niue.
