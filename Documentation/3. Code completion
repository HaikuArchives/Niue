	CODE COMPLETION


As of version four Niue tries to help you writing code by suggesting possible function names, 
constants and c++ keywords. Whenever you are typing a string that Niue recognizes a list of 
hints appears in the bottom-right corner. To access this list press F12 on your keyboard, 
use your mouse or the up and down arrows to navigate the list. Pressing enter replaces your 
typing with the selected hint.

If this 'code-completion' is annoying you, choose 'View->Code Completion' to turn it off.
