Niue Documentation


	SNIPPETS


Niue snippets will be familiar for those who have used Microsoft Visual Studio and they work pretty 
much the same. Right-click anywhere in the sourcecode to bring up the snippets menu. Choosing a 
snippet will insert it's code at the cursor location.

Although there are some build in snippets, you can get most out of them by adding your own.
Added snippets are saved in your config folder so if you don't manually delete them they are
never lost. To add snippets open the 'Snippet Manager'. As for the snippet code, linebreaks are
not allowed yet, please also remember that all snippets must have unique names.
